# targeted-password-brute-force
A Python tool that simulates a targeted brute-force attack by generating password guesses using personal information like name, surname, date of birth, and other custom keywords. It mimics real-world attack logic used in social engineering and demonstrates how weak or predictable passwords can be cracked.
